          We share the view that the scaling law continues to permeate all
          aspects of neural systems research, from vision over the past decade
          [4] to natural language now. We hope to continue this trend with our
          action model by collecting more data on human actions on computers and
          designing more scalable architectures for them. Over the long run, we
          believe that AI will fundamentally transform economically meaningful
          work and will play an important part in reshaping our infrastructure,
          starting with the increasingly nontrivial cost of developing and
          training them. We have confidence in the vast benefits that these
          large systems may provide in relation to the resources needed to
          develop them [1]. Understanding actions will in turn help redesign
          human-machine interactions and can result in more intuitive and useful
          natural language-powered systems and devices, benefiting all
          stakeholders, from service providers, consumers, and hardware
          manufacturers, to software developers.
